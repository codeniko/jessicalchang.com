    <div class="about-text">
      I’m a UX Designer, creator, adventurer, and foodie. Three years ago, I moved from New York to California and it’s been an exciting and valuable learning experience. I’ve learned that it’s important to take risks and that the only constant thing in life is change.<br><br>

      I started my career as a project manager, but didn’t find my passion or purpose in the work I was producing.  But through that experience, I learned about UX Design and with months of research and courses, I took a chance and decided to make a career change.<br><br>

      I want to make a positive impact on the world and I’m driven to solving complex problems with creative solutions. You’ll find that I’m always up for a challenge and eager to contribute. In addition to making a positive impact through design, I’m passionate about equality, food, travel, and appreciating the simple things in life.
