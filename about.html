      I’m a Product Designer, craft enthusiast, adventurer, and foodie (especially when it comes to dessert). It’s been 5 years since I moved from New York to California and it’s taught me a lot about taking risks and embracing change. Looking back, I’ve found that I’ve grown the most during the uncomfortable and challenging times in my life and career. That’s something I intend to continue doing.<br><br>

      I pursued a career in design because it was a space where I could be creative and build something that touches and impacts people. But I’ve learned that it’s so much more than just design, it’s about working with people from different backgrounds and perspectives to identify a problem, brainstorm solutions and test assumptions. It’s exciting and challenging given how fast technology evolves and how it can solve and create new problems.<br><br>

      When I’m not designing, I love baking, finding interesting books to add to my collection, taking photos of my cats (though I don’t think they love it as much) and just appreciating the simple things in life.
