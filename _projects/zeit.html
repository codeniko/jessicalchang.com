          <h2>Overview</h2>
          The human race has been dreaming about time travel for ages. Now it’s finally possible through Zeit, a subsidiary of Richard Branson’s Virgin empire. With the help of Elon Musk, Virgin has been able to make time travel available to all.  Zeit is looking to create a new brand and build a responsive ecommerce website where they can sell travel packages to different times.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          Due to the innovative nature of Zeit, prior time travel experience from users was unavailable. It came down to understanding what core information was needed. What are some pain points of booking ordinary travel? How do users currently book travel? Why do users choose certain destinations over others. To answer those questions, I conducted competitive analysis with companies in similar industries and user interviews.

          <h2>Define</h2>
          Using tools like storyboarding and empathy maps, I found the following key takeaways that led me to my persona:
          <ol>
            <li> Users need to research and book activities beforehand.</li>
            <li> Users are interested in learning about the history
              and culture of the destination</li>
            <li> Users value friends inputs</li>
            <li> Traveling out of the country comes with many
          frustrations like language barrier, unfamiliarity with
          location and rules.</li>
          </ol>

          From there, I started thinking about information architecture and user flows. I conducted a card sorting activity, created a site map and built out the task and user flows.

          <h2>Design</h2>
          In the design phase, I focused on four areas:
          <ol>
            <li>Wireframing</li>
            <li>Responseive Design</li>
            <li>Branding</li>
            <li>UI Design</li>

          <h2>Test</h2>
          To test, I primarily used Invision but also experimented with POP by Marvel in the early stages of my wireframes and responsive design. I conducted usability testing with Invision and was able to include a few of the participants from the user research stage.

          <h2>Next steps</h2>
          Based on the feedback from the usability testing, I created an affinity map and made some high-priority changes. The next steps were to use Zeplin and create a redline document to handoff to engineers.<br><br>

          This was a great project to not only learn the UX process but also to understand the research and development challenges of a product in an innovative space.
